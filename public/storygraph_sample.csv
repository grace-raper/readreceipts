Because of Winn-Dixie,Kate DiCamillo,"",9780763616052,paperback,read,2025/01/08,2025/01/19,2025/01/19,1,"",,,,,,,4.0,"In middle and high school, I was a Quizlet power user. I made flashcards for just about everything and would study them on the school bus or while walking to class. For six years, I created weekly vocabulary flashcards for Friday quizzes. Once, in my freshman honors English class, a girl got caught cheating when her phone started reading aloud the definition—my definition—of the word melancholy. She got a brief reprimand, her phone was confiscated for the day, and her real punishment was having to finish the quiz on her own.<br><br>I felt a little bad for her, maybe a little proud that she had chosen my definition to cheat with. But I was also amused that she got caught looking up the word <i>melancholy</i>. I thought everyone knew it. The word had been part of my vocabulary for what felt like forever.<br><br>Re-reading <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>, I realized the first time the word entered my life. I was sitting on the rug at the front of my second-grade classroom, staring at the small fish tattoo that peeked out from my teacher’s ballet flat as she sat cross-legged reading aloud. It was Opal’s father, The Preacher, who introduced me to the word, and I haven’t forgotten it since. I liked the way it sounded, just as Opal did: “like there was music hidden somewhere inside it.”<br><br>Returning to this book as an adult was inspired by Ann Patchett’s essay in <i>These Precious Days</i>, where she recounts discovering Kate DiCamillo’s work and falling in love with her children’s books. In her introduction to the 20th-anniversary edition of <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>, Patchett writes that “it is the central fantasy of childhood—and maybe of life—that you alone can see the goodness and potential in someone whose goodness and potential no one else sees.” That sentiment captures so much of the book’s magic: the transformative power of love and friendship; the idea that you should judge people not by their past, but by what they are doing with their present; that you can't hold onto something that wants to go; and it's important to love what you have while you have it.<br><br>Hope, resilience, and friendship are central to <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>, but so is an acknowledgment of life’s sadness, loss, and fear. As Opal reflects: “I lay there and thought how life was like a Litmus Lozenge, how the sweet and the sad were all mixed up together and how hard it was to separate them out.” <br><br>DiCamillo has been asked before how honest a children’s author should be with their readers: Is the job of the writer to tell the truth or to preserve the innocence of their young audience?<br><br>The truth is that kids are a lot smarter and more observant than we give them credit for. They see when people are unkind to each other. They notice their parents arguing. They pick up on political divides and overhear harsh words. On the podcast <i>On Being with Krista Tippett</i>, DiCamillo said, children are “aware of everything that’s going on, and what a disservice not to talk to them. And also, at the same time, what a disservice not to offer them hope and love, because that’s what stories do, too. But they also need to tell the truth. And the truth is that it’s really difficult to be here. It is a huge gift to be here. It’s beautiful here. And it’s also challenging.” (<a href=""https://onbeing.org/programs/kate-dicamillo-on-nurturing-capacious-hearts/"">podcast linked here</a>)<br><br>For years, I've remembered <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i> as a sweet story about a dog, only to realize, reading it again, that it was also the book that planted the word <i>melancholy</i> into my life. <br><br>Sweet and sad are simply parts of life. The trick is learning how to live with them both. Stories like DiCamillo’s <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i> show us how. <br><br><i>Melancholy</i> (noun): a feeling of pensive sadness, typically with no obvious cause.","",,"",No

The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,"",9780316769174,paperback,read,2024/10/26,2024/11/13,2024/11/13,1,"",,,,,,,4.0,"A few months ago, I picked up The Catcher in the Rye after seeing a girl on TikTok say, ""If a guy says this is his favorite book, run."" I was intrigued. I hadn’t read it—never having been assigned it in high school—and knew little about it beyond its reputation as an iconic portrayal of teenage angst.<br><br>It appears that the “red flag” discourse around Catcher stems from two main ideas (in addition to its associations with John Lennon’s murder and the attempted assassination of Reagan). First, because it’s often assigned in early high school, people assume that calling it a favorite indicates a lack of reading since tenth grade—a sort of intellectual immaturity.<br><br>The second reason is more nuanced and centers around Holden Caulfield himself. Holden is a contradictory character, displaying an insufferable self-centeredness that might be relatable as a teenager but is hard to excuse in an adult. Critics have labeled him a “first-generation incel” and a “proto–school shooter,” viewing his bitterness and isolation as signs of dangerous mindsets. Others argue, though, that Holden is simply a vulnerable, traumatized sixteen-year-old, grieving his brother’s death and feeling abandoned by a society that provides him with neither role models nor compassion. Dismissing him as merely an angry teen overlooks his deeper vulnerabilities.<br><br>Upon reading it, I found Holden to be a character I could feel sympathy for. Yes, he’s hypocritical and annoying, but he’s also terrified of change and clings to the idea of being “The Catcher in the Rye”—a protector for children from the “phony” adult world. He shows empathy for others, even apologizing to the teacher who fails him. His love for his younger sister, Phoebe, is genuinely touching.<br><br>In New York, Holden practically begs for someone to listen to him. His attempts to reach out to adults are ignored, except for one schoolteacher who tries to “help” him but possibly only with a predatory intent. This neglect leaves him angry and cynical, yet still, we feel for him. We hope he’ll find someone who truly listens and understands.<br><br>While reading Catcher on Election Day this year, I found myself wondering what Holden would be like as an 18-year-old voter today. He’d probably skip voting, but if pushed, I think he’d vote for Trump. Despite his love for his sister and desire to protect young people, Holden’s disillusionment might draw him to a candidate who presents himself as an outsider—someone unafraid to reject the norms Holden despises.<br><br>Holden’s creator, J.D. Salinger, saw more combat in World War II than almost any other American soldier. He was on Utah Beach on D-Day, at the Battle of the Bulge, and one of the first Americans to enter a liberated concentration camp. Historically, Salinger isn’t part of the “Lost Generation” (a term referring to people who came of age during or just after World War I), but in many ways, Holden feels like a character from this generation.<br><br>The Lost Generation found the conservative morals of their parents irrelevant in a postwar world. President Harding’s call for a return to “normalcy” left them feeling spiritually alienated, as they faced what they believed to be hopelessly provincial, materialistic lives. After witnessing so much death, they rejected traditional ideas of behavior, gender roles, and morality, often acting recklessly in pursuit of personal freedom. Like them, Holden is “lost”—disconnected from society and wandering in search of something authentic.<br><br>This brings me to my central question: if we can sympathize with Holden’s disillusionment, should we also find sympathy for young men today who feel disconnected from modern definitions of masculinity? The men who voted for Trump, who tune into 'manosphere' media, who represent a sort of  Gen Z ""Lost Generation,"" craving a place in a world that feels unstable. <br><br>I think I can. I think more people need to, and I worry about the consequences of continuing to ignore or brush aside this “lost generation” of men—men who, like Holden Caulfield, are searching for connection,  pleading for someone to help them make sense of where they fit in an ever-shifting world. <br><br>The original “Lost Generation” found escape in drinking, indulged in sexual freedom to defy societal norms, and threw themselves into material comforts to distract from an unsteady sense of self. But Gen Z’s response to disillusionment seems different. Studies show they drink less, engage in less sex, and in many ways embody more restraint. Perhaps their coping mechanisms have shifted; perhaps tuning into hypermasculine media (the “manosphere” ran by Joe Rogan &amp; co.) is the Gen Z equivalent of drinking—a kind of social escape, a way to bond over shared discontent.<br><br>Like alcohol, this media isn’t inherently “a force for good,” but it’s not pure, unadulterated evil either. Just as many people can drink responsibly, I think plenty of young men can listen to these voices and find a sense of camaraderie without absorbing the underlying misogyny wholesale.<br><br>Yet, as with alcohol, it's possible to (in Holden's words) ""start to go over the cliff""— the to end up legitimately idolizing someone like Andrew Tate - or, if you're following my analogy: fall into the trap of alcoholism. So rather than rejecting (or unfollowing, blocking, etc.) anyone who 'drinks' perhaps we should aim to be the ‘Catcher in the Rye’ for these men, extending understanding before this once-occasional crutch becomes the only thing they can lean on.<br><br><i>But if I, as a woman, am willing to extend sympathy to this large group of men—some of whom I deeply disagree with, but can still feel for—shouldn’t I also be able to expect that if the roles were reversed, they’d do the same? Because, in truth, the roles are reversed</i>. <br><br>Ignoring the fears and feelings of others in today’s politics is very much a two-way street. So shouldn’t we also expect the men in our lives to listen to women? And not just the individual women they feel it’s their role to protect—the wives, daughters, sisters, and girlfriends—but also the collective voices of women in their country. A generation of women are now afraid for their bodily autonomy, just as a generation of men feel unsure of their place in the world.<br><br>I'll also acknowledge that framing this issue as simply “men vs. women” is reductive. There are intersecting factors at play—race, class, sexuality—that influence experiences of disconnection and belonging. These additional layers of identity shape how individuals experience societal expectations, complicating the dynamics of empathy and understanding across different groups. Still, exploring this in the context of gender can shed light on one significant dimension of today’s empathy gap.<br><br>A recent episode of The Daily (10/23/2024, “The Gender Election”) highlights this divide among young voters. According to the episode, men and women under 30 are now the most politically polarized generation. Many young men support Trump, supporting his economic policies and feeling that his outsider persona resonate with their sense of dislocation. By contrast, young women are often repelled, citing the rollback of reproductive rights and Trump’s misogynistic rhetoric.<br><br>In the podcast episode, The Times conducted interviews with these young voters. At the end of the interviews, the young women were asked if they could empathize with Trump-supporting men. Unsurprisingly, the young men weren’t asked in turn if they could empathize with the Kamala-supporting women (or if they were, it was cut for time in post-production).<br><br>A Substack post by Sara Hildreth, a former high school English teacher, offers an illuminating perspective on this empathy gap in her essay “Boy books, girl books, and the politics of reading.” Hildreth describes how, in her teaching experience, it was expected that girls could relate to male protagonists like Holden Caulfield or Gatsby. But asking boys to engage with female-led narratives like Jane Eyre or Beloved was often dismissed out of hand, as if boys’ empathy simply couldn’t stretch that far.<br><br>Young men, the author argues, aren’t often encouraged to see themselves in stories like Jane Eyre, where the heroine is completely dependent, or to understand the precarity faced by the Bennet sisters, who risk destitution without marriage. The violence and trauma experienced by Sethe in Beloved—and the horrific choices she makes—are similarly distanced from boys’ reading lists. “I have heard English teachers scoff at the very notion that boys should have to read Jane Eyre or are mature enough to handle Toni Morrison,” Hildreth observes.<br><br>This lack of exposure in literature, the author suggests, hinders men’s empathy beyond the classroom. “If young boys in schools are not asked or expected to connect with other experiences in books, when will we begin to teach them how to connect with other experiences in the real world?” The article points out a societal gap—reflected in how men prioritize their own roles within family dynamics over understanding the needs of women in their lives. Hildreth argues that “This is why we hear again and again from politicians in every party urging men to think about the lives of their wives, mothers, daughters and sisters. We don’t expect that men can empathize with women at large, so we beg them to consider those closest to them.” <br><br>Reflecting on my own education, I can see this bias in hindsight. In six years of English classes, mostly led by women, we only read two novels with female protagonists: To Kill a Mockingbird in seventh grade, and Kindred in tenth. I elected to read The Handmaid’s Tale and The Scarlet Letter as outside reading projects, but I doubt most boys in my did.<br><br>At the time, I didn’t question this, but looking back, I wonder how it has shaped all of us—what empathy was gained or lost by the books we were encouraged, or not encouraged, to read.","",,"",No

Cathy &amp; Heathcliff are star-crossed lovers but Heathcliff class/race, and Cathy’s social ambitions keep them apart. That element exists, but I’d caution anyone against reading this purely as a 'romance' novel.<br><br>I think it reads far better (and more nuanced) as an exploration of intergenerational trauma. It’s about the cost of hurting others, the way we sabotage our own happiness to punish someone else, and how revenge poisons everyone it touches.<br><br>I also came away with a much deeper respect for Brontë’s craft. The first time through, I was so consumed by my loathing for the characters that I missed how meticulously structured the book is. The characters, setting, and language are intricate and obviously purposeful, yet the book and all the emotions it brings feel raw and untamed. <br><br>——————————<br><br>2023 review: <br><br>3 stars - It’s worth reading.

Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,J.D. Vance,"",9780063045989,paperback,read,2025/11/21,2025/05/11,2025/05/11,1,"",,,,,,,4.0,"Is the ""American Dream"" dead? I guess we'd first need to define what the American Dream actually is. So often we think of it as the opportunity for upward mobility. Work hard and you'll be rewarded with a career, a house, a family, and stability. A collection of material successes.<br><br>But I think something more fundamental lies at the heart of the American Dream: the ability to constantly reinvent yourself. Underneath all those material milestones is something deeper—the freedom to become someone new. The modern markers of adulthood may be material things like a car, a diamond ring, a house, or even a child, but they also offer a new identity. You reinvent yourself as a ""driver,"" ""fiancé,"" ""homeowner,"" or ""parent.""<br><br>Reinvention is something we deeply crave as humans. As kids, we dress up and play make-believe. As adults, we look forward to being someone else, someone new, every Halloween. The freedom to constantly reinvent yourself is very core to the American identity. Consider that America is a country of immigrants. Many people who came through Ellis Island were given or chose a new name on the spot. They left behind old identities and old careers to become someone entirely new: an instant reinvention.<br><br>I picked up <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> earlier this year after reading George Packer's Atlantic profile of Vance, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/07/jd-vance-reinvention-power/682828/"">""The Talented Mr. Vance.""</a> Packer writes:<br><blockquote>""Still only 40, Vance is likelier than anyone to be the next president. [...] His rise has been so dramatic and self-dramatized that he calls to mind those emblematic figures from history who seem both out of a storybook and all too human, such as Shoeless Joe Jackson and Huey Long. [...] More than any other public figure of this century, including Barack Obama (to whom his career bears some similarities), and even Trump, Vance illuminates the larger subject of contemporary America's character. In another age, his rise might have been taken as proof that the American dream was alive and mostly well. But our age has no simply inspiring and unifying tales, and each chapter of Vance's success is part of a national failure: the abandonment of American workers under global neoliberalism; the cultural collapse of the working class; the unwinnable forever war; a dominant elite that combines ruthless competition with a rigid orthodoxy of identity; a reaction of populist authoritarianism. What seems like Vance's tragic wrong turn, the loss of real promise, was probably inevitable—it's hard to imagine a more hopeful plot.""</blockquote><br><i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> came out a few months before the 2016 election at the very last moment for a book like this to shape the national conversation. Just months later we entered a political era where it was no longer possible to have an honest response to a narrative across political battle lines.<br><br>In this memoir, Vance is earnest, sensitive, and kind. The book feels painfully sincere. The narrator is honest enough to show himself being hotheaded, cowardly, and insecure. He loves his family and community but is honest about their failures. He rejects tribal grievance. He doesn't settle for easy answers.<br><br>It's easy now to read <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> as a work of bad faith: calculated and opportunistic. We view every line through a lens of suspicion because of who Vance is today. But I think that to do so would be extremely unfair.<br><br>Vance's change between then and now is perhaps another example of this idea that the true American Dream is constant reinvention. J.D. Vance's life has been one long, dramatic reinvention: poor hillbilly, Marine, Yale lawyer, venture capitalist, memoirist, Never Trump politician, Trump's vice president. Just 41 years old, and Vance has reinvented himself many times over.<br><br>There's something unsettling about knowing that people change and reinvent themselves. It's like going to your partner's childhood home over the holidays and realizing a different version of them existed for their family — a version you'll never meet. People constantly shed themselves in tiny increments and sometimes end up very different from who you first knew. It's a type of loss.<br><br>But for us as individuals, there's something beautiful and alluring and hopeful in the idea that we're not stuck with one fixed self. Reinvention keeps New Year's resolutions alive. It motivates people to go to therapy, to the gym, to bookstores.<br><br>If we consider the ability to ""reinvent yourself"" and reboot your identity as central to the American Dream, we must also consider how our digital age makes this increasingly impossible. Reinvention used to be a matter of moving across the country or choosing a new job title. Now, a few seconds after meeting someone, we can type their name into the Instagram search bar and scroll back through years of pictures. Just cosmetically, we can find the before and after of a boob job, lip filler, or rhinoplasty. We can find someone's natural hair color or determine if the timeline in which they lost weight means they're on Ozempic.<br><br>A bad joke from 2012 can resurface in 2025; it doesn't matter that 2025 you would never say something like that. 2012 you did. You can't outrun your past when every earlier version of yourself is catalogued, searchable, and screenshot-able.<br><br>It's much more anxiety-inducing to try and become someone new, take the leap of reinvention, and try to be someone better when there's always the threat of your past mistakes resurfacing. Your reinvention being deemed inauthentic by the observer who can compare multiple versions of you.<br><br>In the same Atlantic piece, Packer wrote: ""With his gifts of intellect and rhetoric, Vance might have brought the country’s conflicting strands together. They had combined to make him, and he knew them deeply—their flaws, their possibilities, their entwined fate. Instead, he took a path of extreme divisiveness to the peak of power, becoming a hard-line convert to the Catholic Church, post-liberal populism, and the scorched-earth cause of Donald Trump. Vance became a scourge of the elites among whom he’d found refuge, a kingpin of a new elite, avenging wrongs done to his native tribe.""<br><br>I wonder if it would be possible for Vance to reinvent himself again? To change his views and become a force for unity, as Packer suggested was possible pre-Trump? I think 25 years ago, the answer would have been yes. But today, I think it's no. Every future version of Vance will have to coexist with every past version, archived online forever, weaponized by every opponent, lingering in every search result.<br><br>On the surface, this is kind of comforting. The fact that we have a way to record the bad things people have done makes us less likely to be tricked or deceived. We can judge a person's goodness based on the digital artifacts of their past. But the more we think about it, the sadder it becomes. By constantly comparing people to their former selves, we don't give them the space to grow and change. And how can we ever become a better country if we don't allow for that growth?<br><br>If the American Dream has always rested on the possibility of redemptive reinvention—on the belief that who we were doesn't have to define who we are—then without that possibility, we lose more than individual transformation. We lose our collective capacity for progress.","",,"",No

Women dream of themselves being dreamt of. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. Women constantly meet glances which act like mirrors reminding them of how they look or how they should look. Behind every glance is a judgment. Sometimes the glance they meet is their own, reflected back from a real mirror [...] She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. Whilst she is walking across a room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to others and in particular how she appears to men is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life.""<br><br>Berger was the first to analyze this concept of “male gaze” and in doing so served as inspiration for many other modern day feminist works/research.<br><br>As far as this collection of selected essays go, I was very happy with how comprehensive it was. Berger was a great essayist and wrote prolifically. Candidly, I’m marking this as read without finishing the entire book (I read about 1/3 of the essays) but will definitely come back and finish it with I feel like I can stomach some more dense -but very interesting!- art criticism.<br><br>My favorites so far have been “Art and Property Now” and “The Changing View of Man in the Portrait”.","",,"",No

I don’t know whether to be relived or disappointed that that was not the case. <br><br>If my expeditions were not so high, I probably would have adored it. Exceptions being where they were I found it to be a mostly entertaining mess. I also feel like this second installment really lacked for a plot, it was basically just 1000 enjoyable pages of setup for the third book.<br><br>Things I liked: <br><br>- I adored Rhun and loved the day / night relationship! This is the storyline I’m most excited to see play out in CC3.<br><br>Things I disliked:<br><br>- The language used is so explicit it looses all meaning. I don’t mind explicit language, but by using it so frequently it really looses all its meaning. It feels when teenagers are constantly swearing in order to seem/feel “grown up”. In Maas’s first series as an adult novelist, she uses swearing and graphic scenes as a crutch in an attempt to make these feel different from her previous YA writing.<br><br>- “male gaze”: Bryce is constantly sexualized in this book which, although annoying, I could accept from the standpoint of it being something she embraces. The concept of there being power in sexuality is obviously not new. However, the way that Maas conveys this really feels like the was that a male author would write a woman embracing her sexuality vs the way that a female author would.<br><br>- What is up with Danika and all her secrets? Can’t there be another way to introduce a plot twist? I feel like all the plot twist were predictable and feel a little flat (even the identify of day’s character was not much of a surprise).<br><br>My Unpopular Opinions: <br><br>- Bryce. I don’t love her. I also don’t know if I was ever fully on board with Bryce and Hunt, but I feel like they lost a lot of chemistry in this installment. All of the fun banter and friendship has been replaced by super cringey sex. Honestly, despite being mates, I’ll be surprised if they end up together.<br><br>- I did not love the ending. For context, I didn’t love “Avengers: Endgame” but I know that a large majority of people do so feel free to take this critique with a grain of salt. I worry that by reintroducing beloved characters from her previous works Maas is taking the “easy way out” rather than taking the time to fully develop some of the the other supporting characters from the this universe (and there is no shortage of supporting characters to choose from in the CC universe).","",,"",No

(or: produced by A.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; directed by B.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.). In it you will see Miss C.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; Miss D.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; Miss E.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; and Mr. F.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; Mr. G.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; Mr. H.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; and many others. The name of the town is Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire—just across the Massachusetts line: latitude 42 degrees 40 minutes; longitude 70 degrees 37 minutes. The First Act shows a day in our town. The day is May 7, 1901. The time is just before dawn.""</blockquote><br><br>This opening pins the play to an exact time and place. Even when the play first premiered in 1938, 1901 was already long past. And yet, <i>Our Town</i> resonates deeply. Why?<br><br>In recent years, I’ve been obsessed with Noah Kahan’s album <i>Stick Season</i>, which captures the specificity of his experience growing up in small-town Vermont. The album’s title — <i>Stick Season</i> — refers to what Kahan describes as a uniquely New England phenomenon: the transitional period between the fall and winter.<br><br>Kahan often expresses his surprise and gratitude that the album resonates far beyond New England. He marvels at the fact that audiences from across the globe show up to sing, dance, and cry to his songs about small-town life: ""They can’t all be from Vermont or New Hampshire. They’re from all over the world and all over the country, and it’s an unbelievable feeling.""<br><br>This phenomenon, that the specific is often what resonates the most universally, is at the heart of Our Town. The truths embedded in Grover’s Corners belong to all of us. As Wilder shows, specificity doesn’t alienate. Specificity invites us in. Its universality isn’t born from grand gestures but from small truths: the rituals of family breakfasts, the awkwardness of first love, the unrelenting passage of time.<br><br>Like Kahan’s songs, Our Town roots itself in the deeply personal, making it all the more meaningful to audiences far removed from its setting.<br><br>Unlike Kahan, I don’t think Wilder was surprised by his play’s universal appeal. The title, Our Town, speaks for itself. It suggests ownership, connection, and shared humanity. Grover’s Corners becomes a microcosm of the human experience.<br><br>I decided I pick up <i>Our Town</i> after finishing Ann Patchett's Tom Lake. Given that Tom Lake had already ""spoiled"" the ending for me, I wasn't expecting this play to make me that emotional. I knew, or at least thought I knew, what was coming.<br><br>I was very very wrong. I watched some stolen version on YouTube of the TV movie for the 2003 Westport Country Playhouse production with Paul Newman as Stage Manager and I <i>sobbed</i> at the end. When reading a note from Wilder's nephew at the end of the script, I learned that this particular production came together, at least in part, as a response to 9/11: <br><br><blockquote>""Theaters increasingly turn to <i>Our Town</i> seeking a way to celebrate and depict hard-won lessons about the preciousness of life and community in the wake of trauma. Take, for example, Joanne Woodward’s decision to produce <i>Our Town</i>, starring Paul Newman, at Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut, and later on Broadway, in response to the 9/11 attacks. And following the 2017 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena in the UK, the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre mounted an enormously moving, successful production of <i>Our Town</i> dedicated to the memory of those who had died.""</blockquote><br><br>Emily’s final words resonate deeply: “Oh, earth, you're too wonderful for anybody to realize you. Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it—every, every minute?” The beauty of life lies in its smallest moments and that noticing them is what it means to be human.","",,"",No

For some, it meant grueling demands on essential workers and healthcare providers; for others, the privilege of working from home and newfound flexibility. It revealed, with painful clarity, the disparities of life in America, as George Floyd’s murder ignited nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. It brought innovation and global cooperation—like the race to develop a vaccine—while also exposing deep divisions and systemic inequities. And for many, it was a period of stillness, of both fear and reflection.<br><br>Contrast is at the heart of Ann Patchett’s <i>Tom Lake</i>, where the pandemic serves as a subtle but resonant backdrop. It’s impossible to ignore the heartbreak of that time—I remember spending hours each morning glued to my phone, following news about lockdown mandates, death tolls in Italy, the latest protests, and vaccine developments. But the pandemic also had a way of slowing life down, encouraging me to notice the quiet joys of the everyday. Patchett captures this duality so well. Beneath the uncertainty and fear of <i>Tom Lake</i> lies a celebration of the present moment, a reminder to hold close what truly matters.<br><br>At the center of the novel is Lara Kenison, a cherry farmer, mother, and former actress, who spends her pandemic summer with her three grown daughters, Emily, Maisie, and Nell. The girls, forced to return home due to the pandemic, become the new cherry-picking crew on their Michigan farm. To pass the time, Lara shares the story of a pivotal summer in her twenties when she acted in summer stock theater, fell in love with Peter Duke—an aspiring actor who would later become a famous movie star—and made choices that would forever shape her life.<br><br>The novel is steeped in nostalgia, both for Lara’s youth and for the simpler, slower rhythm of life on the cherry farm. I found myself reflecting on my own pandemic experience as Lara’s daughters navigated their summer in a safe, comforting bubble. Like them, I spent those months with family, balancing global anxiety with the grounding simplicity of home. I remember the slow, unhurried days at my parents’ house—drinking black coffee on the front porch, inching my chair back to stay in the shade a little longer. I watched college lectures on Zoom while lying in the grass, picked blueberries from the backyard, and discovered the joy of listening to entire albums instead of playlists.<br><br>Even the subtext of Lara’s story is rich with this theme of contrast. She was a good actress with good connections and the reader cannot help but to image the life she could have had—one filled with fame, money, and glamour—had she stayed in California and pursued acting. Instead, she chose a quieter, more grounded existence as a mother, wife, and farmer. As she shares her memories, Lara insists she has no regrets about the life she built, but I can’t help wondering, just a little, if she let's herself wonder about the paths not taken. It’s a tension that’s deeply human: imagining the ""what-ifs"" while still cherishing the beauty of the life you’ve chosen.<br><br>Listening to the audiobook, narrated by Meryl Streep, was an experience all its own. Streep’s warm, intimate performance made me feel as though Lara was speaking directly to me, and her voice brought the story to life with such depth and nuance. I mostly listened while running, imagining myself under the sun-drenched summer of a Michigan cherry orchard. In reality, I was trudging through the foggy Snohomish winter, but even here, there's plenty to appreciate —deer grazing on frosted grass, evergreen trees standing tall, and, on clear days, the snow-capped mountains in the distance.<br><br>Patchett’s prose is poetic without ever feeling forced. <i>Tom Lake</i> is a slower burn of a novel, one that invites you to reflect on the people you love, to find beauty in the fleeting moments, and to appreciate the simple life—a life rooted in connection, in place, in purpose. Like a cherry orchard in bloom, its joys are all the more precious for their impermanence.","",,"",No

It’s a quick read and leans heavily into its own chaos. <br><br>Shakespeare takes the basic plot from Plautus’s Menaechmi, then cranks it up a notch: two sets of identical twins separated at birth. One pair are both named Antipholus, and the other pair fills a servant for each. Both identical servants are named Dromio. They come together in Ephesus, but don't meet their twin counterparts until the end of play. The result? A ridiculous mess of mistaken identities, farce, and some truly baffling encounters.<br><br>The humor hinges on us accepting that these characters are so committed to their illogical reasoning that, for example, Egeon and his wife, parents of twins so identical they can only be told apart by name, would name them the same thing.<br><br>Or that Antipholus of Syracuse spends seven years desperately searching for his long-lost twin brother, whom without, he describes himself:<br><blockquote><br>“I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, falling there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself. So I, to find a mother and a brother, In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.” —Antipholus of Syracuse, Act 1, Scene 2<br></blockquote><br>When complete strangers start greeting him like they know him, demanding money, or calling him “husband,” he never once thinks, “Hmm, could this be my twin brother?” No— obviously this strange treatment is the result of witchcraft. <br><br><i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is a play that revels in its absurdity, which is exactly why it works.","",,"",No

With a humanities background and a passion for innovation and social impact, Wiener is drawn into the world of tech startups, only to discover a reality that falls far short of the utopia she had imagined.<br><br>The memoir captures Wiener's experiences working at various tech startups and offers insights into the fast-paced growth of the industry and the culture of ""disruption"" that has become synonymous with Silicon Valley. Her writing style is vivid, providing a clear picture of the world she describes, and her wit and humor shine through, making the book a compelling and enjoyable read.<br><br>However, at times, Wiener's cleverness overshadows the actual story she is trying to tell. Her tendency to compose pretty metaphors and clever insights into random aspects of life in the valley can distract from the memoir's core message.<br><br>As a woman who has worked in the startup world, I felt both seen and erased while reading ""Uncanny Valley."" While Wiener highlights her own struggles with being a woman in the technology industry, she fails to flesh out any of her encounters with other women beyond a few sentences providing the reader with a sense that women are unimportant to the storyline. Despite this, I would expect that many women who have worked in technology will identify with some or most of the experiences she describes.<br><br>Ultimately, ""Uncanny Valley"" offers an important and insightful perspective on the tech industry, with a particular focus on Silicon Valley. Wiener's memoir does not necessarily break new ground on the issues faced by women in tech, but it provides a unique and honest look into the personal toll that working in the industry can take. In short, it is a thought-provoking and engaging read.","",,"",No

The stops on my hometown tour route are all pretty mundane locations that I know must be boring for my guest: my high school, my favorite grocery store, the restaurant where I had my first job. <br><br>But I imagine that whenever anyone from a small town gives a late-night driving hometown tour, the local high school is on the itinerary. We all know what a high school looks like, but somehow showing someone ""yours"" feels important.<br><br>There is a lot of nostalgia around places and objects; it's much easier to separate out only the positive memories around these inanimate objects than it is to do with people, and therefore places become very nostalgic. Homes (essential places full of objects) even more so. I think that capturing the nostalgia around place that Patchett succeeds most with <i>The Dutch House</i>.<br><br>The Dutch House doesn't achieve the literary permanence of Manderley or Wuthering Heights. For me I can't say that the houser really developed as a character in its own right as some of these other abodes did. However, The siblings' reactions and nostalgia for the home feel deeply realistic.<br><br><i>The Dutch House</i> is a story of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy and their obsessive connection to the iconic family house they lived in as children. After their mother abandons them and their father remarries a cold, ambitious woman named Andrea, the siblings depend entirely on each other. When their father dies, Andrea inherits everything and immediately throws them out. This starts an obsessive ritual where Danny and Maeve return periodically to park across from the Dutch House, gazing at it and recalling memories, wondering how life would have panned out—if only. The emotional baggage they carry together drives them forward but also restricts their successes and the paths they take. The pair is trapped by nostalgia for a version of life that was never actually as happy as they remember, and their constant ""what if"" thinking holds them back from building real futures.<br><br>I've recently added ""Woods Creek Road"" to my hometown tour route. It's long and dark and has no shoulder. It was the type of road you can't speed on because there are blind corners and lots of deer that you could hit if you weren't being careful. But a few years ago, the road received a callout in a Benson Boone song. Now the road—dormant and unnoticeable in my memory for years—has somehow been transformed into something I feel nostalgic for. I imagine all of the late nights I spent returning from volleyball practices, blasting Lonely Island music while I tried to make it home without falling asleep.<br><br>Memory and nostalgia are weird in that way. We can assign memories and meaning to something that maybe didn't have these memories and meaning to us in the first place. This is exactly what happens to Danny and Maeve with the Dutch House—they've built it up in their minds as this perfect lost Eden, when the reality was much more complicated and painful.<br><br>I think nostalgia, particularly for the analog technology of the '90s and early 2000s, is something we'll see even more of this year. The last few years have seen major trends in older photography (Polaroids, film, Super 8, digital cameras) and record players, and I think we'll see growing interest in ""dumb phones,"" DVD collecting, and similar throwbacks neatly packaged in an ""analog living"" trend.<br>It's an interesting form of nostalgia, especially because I feel like it comes from a younger (Gen Z) audience, who didn't really use these objects much or at all in their real lives before they became obsolete. This older technology feels appealing because it stems from longing for a time when technology was new, exciting, and full of promise versus our AI/algorithm-obsessed present where it's addictive, all-consuming, and threatens jobs and autonomy.<br><br>Like the siblings returning to stare at the Dutch House, maybe we're all looking backward because moving forward feels too uncertain. But does this backward gaze help us (can older tech actually help people break phone/dopamine addictions?) or is living in the nostalgia holding us back?","",,"",No

While the book's 350 pages might have been condensed into a sharp, hour-long podcast, the insights are worth exploring—especially her key argument: the biggest obstacle to women’s wages isn’t direct discrimination but the structure of work itself. Goldin shows how “greedy jobs”—roles that demand long, unpredictable hours and reward those always on-call—penalize women who often scale back their work commitments after having children, sacrificing earnings and advancement opportunities.<br><br>Goldin's historical perspective makes her argument even more illuminating. She traces the evolution of women’s work and family choices across five generational cohorts, starting with the “career or family” generation (born 1878–1897) and culminating in the “career and family” generation (born 1958–1978). Her analysis reveals surprising discontinuities shaped by external forces, like the Great Depression, WWII, the advent of the Pill, and no-fault divorce laws. These shifts opened doors for women to delay marriage, invest in careers, and ultimately balance both work and family—though not without trade-offs.<br><br>The book is filled lots of data illustrating just how far women have come in the journey towards equity especially in the educational realm. But while women have achieved unprecedented educational and professional gains, the rising rewards for “greedy jobs” have deepened gender disparities. Goldin convincingly argues that we must rethink how work is structured—making flexible, predictable roles more abundant and rewarding. Her call to action resonates: creating a workplace where flexibility isn’t penalized is essential for advancing gender equity.","",,"",No

The fun of reading classics is that you get the opportunity to realize how universal, across both place and time, so many of our struggles are. Okonkwo is introduced as the strongman of his village, and his obsession with maintaining this hypermasculine image-both in the eyes of himself and his kinsmen, and as a way to distance himself from his father's legacy-ultimately becomes his fatal flaw:<br><br>“Okonkwo ruled his household with a heavy hand. His wives, especially the youngest, lived in perpetual fear of his fiery temper, and so did his little children. Perhaps down in his heart Okonkwo was not a cruel man. But his whole life was dominated by fear, the fear of failure and of weakness. It was deeper and more intimate than the fear of evil and capricious gods and of magic, the fear of the forest, and of the forces of nature, malevolent, red in tooth and claw. Okonkwo's fear was greater than these. It was not external but lay deep within himself. It was the fear of himself, lest he should be found to resemble his father.” (pg. 10)<br><br>Set in the 1890s, the novel deals with the beginnings of British colonialism on the traditional Igbo society in Nigeria. <br><br>One of the most interesting things I took away from this book is the pattern that those who suffer most under the current system often the first to adopt a new one. The villagers who are most discontent are the first to embrace Christianity. On the flip side, characters like Okonkwo, who thrive under the traditional ways, are the most resistant to the changes brought by the missionaries.<br><br>The Ibo people who first converted to Christianity likely didn’t want the missionaries to take control over their clan. They were simply seeking solace from the aspects of their culture that caused them pain—like Nwoye, who was traumatized by the cultural violence that led to his brother Ikemefuna's death, or the mothers forced to abandon their twins due to the belief that they were evil. They found sympathy in Christianity, which offered an alternative to the harshness they faced.<br><br>Okonkwo has the potential to be a great leader, but his unwillingness to sympathize with kinsmen that do not embody the traditional views of his culture eventually leads to his downfall. While it’s clear that the colonizers had no right to impose their beliefs, I can’t help but wonder how things might have turned out differently if there was a willingness to change or adapt some traditions.  Is it possible the Christian missionaries would have struggled to gain such a foothold?<br><br>This idea connects to various moments in history including modern-day America, where radical movements gain strength when people refuse to change or listen to one another. It emphasizes the importance of dialogue and finding common ground during times of upheaval. At the end of the book, Okonkwo sees only one path forward: civil war. When he believes his clan lacks the heart for this fight, he chooses to take his own life rather than seek a new way for the Ibo people. This tragic conclusion underscores the dangers of inflexibility and the dire consequences when leaders refuse to adapt.","",,"",No

Written in 1903, the play takes place just a few years before the Russian Revolution—a period of multiple uprisings and a civil war (1905–1917) that ultimately ended the Romanov dynasty and led to the establishment of a socialist government.<br><br>At its core, the play explores the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of a new middle class, illustrating how traditional power structures were being dismantled and replaced by a rapidly shifting economic reality.<br><br>Madame Ranevsky and her family cling to their ancestral home and its vast, but entirely unproductive, cherry orchard. The orchard spans thousands of acres, yet rather than adapting to the post-serfdom economy and finding the money to hire workers to harvest it, for years the family has simply lets the fruit fall to the ground and rot. Now, facing financial ruin, they can no longer afford the interest on the property, and it is set to be auctioned off.<br><br>Instead of accepting a practical solution—cutting down the orchard and parceling out the land for rent—Ranevsky is too nostalgic for her happy childhood in the orchard and refuses to take action at the expense of her past happiness. refuses to let go of her childhood memories. Though unstated, her reluctance may also be tied to the identity of the potential renters—members of the newly emerging middle class. By allowing the estate to be divided, she would be conceding power to the very people reshaping Russian society. The orchard then serves to represents the past &amp; the deep resistance the aristocracy have to the changes sweeping Russia.<br><br>But nothing is permanent in life except change. In the end, it is Lopakhin—the son of a former serf who once worked on Ranevsky’s land—who purchases the estate. Now a wealthy merchant and part of this new middle class, he wastes no time cutting down the orchard to develop the land.<br><br>Beyond class struggles, The Cherry Orchard also examines how social change impacts individuals at every level of society. The play does not just depict the aristocracy’s downfall but also explores the precarious position of the working class. Servants like Firs, who longs for the days of serfdom, and Dunyasha, who desperately tries to imitate the nobility, reveal how many lower-class individuals were just as unprepared for this new social order. Even Lopakhin, despite his financial success, remains emotionally adrift, unable to fully escape the legacy of his peasant upbringing and denying himself the marriage he wants with Varya because of her membership in the Ranevsky family.<br><br>By portraying the struggles of characters across different social classes, Chekhov suggests that progress, while necessary, is rarely painless—it often leaves people feeling unmoored in its wake.<br><br>-----------<br><br>While reading about this play, I learned about a storytelling concept called Chekhov’s Gun—a narrative principle where an element initially seems insignificant but later proves crucial. It suggests that if a detail is introduced in a story—an object, a character trait, a backstory, an allergy—it should serve a purpose later on. Chekhov’s Gun encourages writers to avoid misleading their audience with details that never pay off. Ironically, The Cherry Orchard breaks this very rule. A gun is introduced in the play, yet it is never fired.","",,"",No

Wharton’s narration captures her perfectly in lines like, “If only everyone would do as she wished she would never be unreasonable” and “it was always hard to make her see why circumstances could not be bent to her wishes.”<br><br>The project was eventually dropped. Audiences rarely object to an unlikeable male hero, but an unlikeable female heroine on a big-budget stage is another story.<br><br>I’ve read most of Wharton’s major works by now, and I’d place her in the very highest tier of writers. She’s still under-recognized for how extraordinary she is as a cultural anthropologist and how modern her characters feel.<br><br>In her autobiography, Wharton notes that Darwin was a major influence. It makes sense: so much of the novel is about ambition, survival, and the ruthless pecking order of Gilded Age New York.<br><br>Undine Spragg (initials U.S., not by accident) carries a name heavy with meaning. She is christened after her grandfather’s most profitable invention, a hair-waving machine that points to her fixation on appearances and the admiration of others. At the same time, “Undine” recalls the water sprite who must marry a mortal to gain a soul. Wharton weaves all this into a character who perfectly embodies the American capitalist consumer: restless, acquisitive, never satisfied, always reaching.<br><br>It is easy to dislike Undine. Yet what makes her harder to embrace than other famous literary anti-heroines, like Becky Sharp, is the very approachability of her desires and methods. She reflects not grand villainy but the quieter, more familiar ambitions of American womanhood.<br><br>Take Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair. Becky is witty, ruthless, and willing to do anything—lie, cheat, steal, perhaps even kill—if it gets her closer to power. Her brazenness is what makes her entertaining. We can watch her with a mix of horror and delight, secure in the belief that we are either too moral or not clever enough to ever behave as she does.<br><br>Undine, by contrast, is better behaved. With each marriage she makes a sincere effort to meet her husband’s expectations, at least for a time. And despite her unhappy unions and the attention she receives from other admirers, she never strays (at least not on her side). Her great “sin” is quieter: she longs for new clothes, fresh admiration, higher social standing, new people to talk to, and the thrill of being in a crowd. When novelty fades, she grows restless and reaches for the next thing. None of these desires are shocking, and that is precisely the point. They are the kinds of longings many of us might quietly share, and Undine pursues them in ways not so different from what we might do if presented with the same opportunities.<br><br>If Becky is relentless, Undine is restless. That restlessness makes her harder to watch, because it feels too close to home. She is a mirror we would rather turn away from, even as we catch our own reflection in her surface.<blockquote>”She had everything she wanted, but she still felt, at times, that there were other things she might want if she knew about them.”</blockquote><br><br>Undine’s hunger is uncomfortably modern. She is the ancestor of the influencer: forever performing, forever wanting. We may scorn her just as we scorn those who live their lives online, but many of us would trade places with them in an instant. Perhaps that is the real “custom of the country.” What makes Undine unbearable is not that she is alien to us, but that she is far too familiar.","",,"",No

Norman Bel Geddes Designs America,Donald Albrecht,"",9781419702990,hardcover,read,2023/03/13,2024/12/27,2024/12/27,1,"",,,,,,,4.0,"A few years ago, me and two friends lived in a teeny-tiny 3 bedroom apartment. My bedroom was so small, that I decided I’d get a twin bed so that I could have a desk and some breathing room in the space.<br><br>My mom and I went to a local industrial salvage store in search of a bed frame. The store had a few options—mostly vintage wooden frames that were beautiful and reasonably priced (around $50). But then, I spotted a matching pair of minimalist yellow steel bed frames. They were a couple chips, dents, and some rust spots, yet the asking price was a steep $245 each. I was intrigued.<br><br>The description claimed they were “Norman Bel Geddes for Simmons Company” and suggested they were around 100 years old, likely used as hospital beds. My mom thought buying a hospital bed might be bad luck, but after Googling Bel Geddes for an hour or so, I concluded these frames <i>probably</i> weren’t from a hospital.<br><br>The deeper I dug into Bel Geddes, the more fascinated I became. It turned out he didn’t just design furniture—he had a hand in everything: Broadway theater sets, appliances, automobiles, even the U.S. interstate highway system. His influence on American design during the 1920s and ’30s was profound. He was a pioneer of “streamlining,” shaping the modern, futuristic vision of America. <br><br>Why had I never heard of him before?  His most influential work was often ephemeral, like the ""Futurama"" exhibition, and he didn't establish a successor firm after closing his office, leaving his legacy less cemented; some of his more ambitious design were not able to get funding due to the Great Depression followed by the war effort; and his posthumous autobiography is less focused on cementing his legacy of broad industrial design and future-oriented vision and instead focused primarily on his theater designs.<br><br>I was hooked. I happily forked over $245 for the bed frame (seemed worth it to own a piece of design history) feeling a bit of guilt about separating the pair that had likely been together for almost a century.<br><br>I then followed this expensive purchase up by spending $80 on a used copy of this book which appeared to be one of the only print sources of info on Bel Geddes and by far the most comprehensive. The book turned out to be amazing. It’s packed with great essays and beautiful photos. Here are a few highlights:<br><br>• <b>Futurama:</b> Bel Geddes designed the General Motors exhibit for the 1939 World’s Fair, which introduced the American public to the concept of the interstate highway system. This exhibit directly influenced the passage of the 1944 Federal-Aid Highway Act and was the most attended attraction at any world’s fair - a record it retained for 20 years until the attendance of “Futurama II” set the new record in 1964. <br><br>• <b>The Mark I Computer:</b> Bel Geddes designed the case for IBM’s Mark I computer, which was presented to Harvard during World War II. At the time, some criticized the project as a waste of resources, but it later became an iconic part of computing history.<br><br>• <b>Aerial Restaurant:</b> For the 1933-34 Chicago World’s Fair, Bel Geddes designed an aerial restaurant—a rotating steel, aluminum, and glass structure that would have offered diners panoramic views of the fairgrounds and the city. Unfortunately, due to the economic downturn after the 1929 crash, it wasn’t built. Still, the design clearly influenced later structures like the Seattle Space Needle.<br><br>• <b>The Origin of “Bel Geddes”:</b> The “Bel” in Norman Bel Geddes is actually the maiden name of his first wife. They published a zine under the name “Bel Geddes,” and the name stuck. Over the course of his life, Bel Geddes had four marriages, but retained the Bel Geddes name for his entire career.<br><br>While my wallet might not have been thrilled about my Bel Geddes rabbit hole, I do love the bed frame and all the design history I learned along the way. Plus, I’ve yet to experience any strange phenomena that would suggest it was ever used as a hospital bed in a previous life.<br><br>Imagine my surprise, then, when eight months later, the price of the second frame was marked down to $60. Apparently, I was the only one who understood the Bel Geddes connection.<br><br>Naturally, I couldn’t resist. I went back and bought the matching frame. Now, the two frames are reunited, and I’ve got a piece of design history (this time at a much more reasonable price). When I went up to the cashier to check out, she confided that she thought the frame would never sell. Turns out, I was the only person who <i>did</i> see the value in the piece.","",,coffee-table,No

It was great, narrated by Riley Keough and Julia Roberts, with clips of Lisa Marie Presley woven throughout. Riley Keough is Lisa Marie’s eldest daughter, and her narration gives the memoir an interesting multigenerational dimension. In completing the memoir for her mother, Riley is able to beautifully blend three portraits at once: Elvis as a father through Lisa Marie’s memories, Lisa Marie in her own words, and Lisa Marie as a mother and grandmother through Riley’s eyes.<br><br>There were so many things I had no idea about: Lisa Marie’s relationship with her dad, her struggles with addiction, her wild and rebellious years, and her marriage to Michael Jackson.<br><br>The memoir feels very honest. It is not “relatable,” but it paints an interesting picture of the unique emotional cost that extreme fame can have on a family. Lisa Marie illustrates how overwhelming it was to be Elvis’s daughter, or to grieve him when the whole world was watching. Living in Elvis’s shadow filled her life with pressure and uncertainty. She wanted real connection but often felt too shy or unsure to trust that people cared about her for the right reasons. The result is a touching portrait of a complicated, sensitive person trying to find her place in a world that never felt normal.","",,"",No

And in that way, it’s powerful. But I think the vignettes come up a little short in making each of the women feel “real”.

Many consider this book to be the inception of the science fiction genre. It is indeed the kernel and the seed of all the later tales of extraterrestrial invasion and tropes of apocalyptic destruction. <br><br>Some twenty years later, Wells's story comes to life in the form of World War I. While humans are pitted against each other rather than extraterrestrial invaders we see a technological arsenal not unlike that of the Martians (cf. mechanised artillery, chemical warfare, surgical strikes).<br><br>While at times I found this book hard to get through, I really enjoyed how Wells gives just as much attention to the ways in which people react to crisis as the Martians' actions themselves. The plot was much less excited to me as a reader in 2023 (who has seen this trope evolve into more exciting forms in pop culture) than it would have likely been to a 19th century reader.

The story revolves around Lauren, who returns home one evening to find her husband Michael waiting for her. The catch? She's not married. Things get even stranger when Michael heads to the attic to change a lightbulb, only for a completely new husband to descend. <br><br>Lauren discovers her attic has a magical quality: an endless supply of husbands. Swapping them out is as easy as swiping left on a dating app. Some are immediate rejections, while others linger before ultimately being sent back up.<br><br>The paradox of choice (sometimes called the ice cream dilemma) is the idea that while a handful of choices can make us feel empowered, too many choices can leave us stressed and unsatisfied. With limitless options we become bogged down in finding that perfect one. We also risk becoming obsessed with missed opportunities. That means that even if the choice we picked was great, we still worry that there may have been something even better out there.<br><br>With a seemingly infinite roster of potential partners, Lauren becomes ensnared in the pursuit of perfection, haunted by the fear of missing out on ""the one"". Whenever there's a flicker of discontent — why not see who is next?<br><br>Last week, a Bill Gates interview went viral where he revealed his biggest regret in life: his divorce from Melinda French Gates. Despite having what I'd assume is a myriad of dating options, it's impossible for anyone new to see him outside the context of being the Bill Gates. There's something profound and special about knowing different versions of a person as they grow—relationships are built on shared history. No matter how ""perfect"" his next partner might be, nothing can replace the 30+ years of memories and experiences he shared with Melinda.<br><br>I thought this was a really interesting details of <i>The Husbands</i> as Lauren meets each new husband without any memory of their relationship.

We read it aloud in 8th grade, and I remember being shocked by the ending—it felt powerful, radical, feminist. A seemingly perfect Victorian housewife, Nora, finds a radical a desire to know who she is independent of her role as a wife &amp; mother and walks out on her husband and children to find out:<br><br><blockquote>HELMER:—To forsake your home, your husband, and your children! You don’t consider what the world will say.<br>NORA:—I can pay no heed to that. I only know what I must do.<br>HELMER:—It is exasperating! Can you forsake your holiest duties in this world?<br>NORA:—What do you call my holiest duties?<br>HELMER:—Do you ask me that? Your duties to your husband and your children.<br>NORA:—I have other duties equally sacred.<br>HELMER:—Impossible! What duties do you mean?<br>NORA:—My duties towards myself.<br>HELMER:—Before all else you are a wife and a mother.<br>NORA:—That I no longer believe. I think that before all else I am a human being, just as much as you are—or at least I will try to become one.</blockquote><br><br>When this play was first performed in 1879—decades before women had the right to vote—the idea that a woman could leave her husband, <i>let alone her children</i>, was unthinkable. Theaters refused to stage it. Audiences were outraged. Ibsen was even pressured to write an alternative ending where Nora stays, because the original was considered too scandalous.  <br><br>But that was almost 150 years ago. <i>Why do we still care?</i> Since then, women have gained the right to vote &amp; achieved financial independence, we now have access to no-fault divorce laws &amp; birth control. And yet—we’re still teaching <i>A Doll’s House</i> in classrooms, still staging it on Broadway. <br><br>The beauty of rereading a classic is that while the text remains the same, I as a reader—and the world around me—have changed.  <br><br>At 14, I read A Doll’s House as a girl on the brink of independence, just months away from starting high school and learning to drive. Unsurprisingly, I was inspired by Nora’s desire for autonomy and self-discovery because it mirrored what I wanted for myself. <br><br>At 24, I find myself more curious about the dynamics between Nora and Torvald that lead to the failure of their marriage. I'm also more intrigued by the budding romance &amp; role-reversal between Mrs. Linde and Krogstad, characters my eighth-grade self dismissed as annoying or villainous. <br><br>As a newly minted adult, I also read the play through the lens of shifting societal norms when it comes to long-term marriages/partnerships: American adults today are significantly less likely to marry or live with a partner than in previous generations. The national marriage rate hovers near an all-time low, and the share of women under 65 not living with a partner has steadily grown since the 1980s. In the past decade, women under 35 have been more likely to live with their parents than with a spouse—a trend unseen since the 1970s.<br><br> If I were asked to take as guess as to why relationships were trending this way, I’d probably venture to assume that due to the soaring educational and economic opportunities available to women, a large subset of degree-holding, career-focused, independent women no longer feel the need to marry. But, that guess would be wrong as the data tells an extremely different story. In 1980, Americans aged 25–34 without a college degree were more likely to marry than college graduates. Today, that’s flipped. Over the past 40 years, relationship formation has declined twice as fast among Americans without a college degree compared to those with one. This marriage gap between education levels continues to grow every year.   Why are the very groups most likely to uphold “traditional” family values—poorer, less-educated, more conservative—less likely to marry? It turns out, these women aren’t rejecting patriarchal marriage ideals; they’re holding men to them. <br><br>A marriage or romantic partnership can be many things: friendship, love, sex, someone to gossip with, someone to remind you to take out the trash.  But, there’s also a key “transaction” at the heart of traditional marriages such as Nora &amp; Torvald’s illustrates in a dolls house: Women provide household management, emotional care, and orchestrate the units social life; Men provide physical protection &amp; financial security.<br><br>Men's odds of being in a relationship today are still highly correlated with their income. Women do not typically invest in long-term relationships with men who have nothing to contribute economically. In the past few decades, young and especially less educated men's income has stagnated, even as women have charged into the workforce and seen their college-graduation rates soar. For single non-college-educated men, average inflation-adjusted earnings at age 45 have fallen by nearly 25 percent in the past half century, while for the country as a whole, average real earnings have more than doubled. As a result, a lot of young men today just don’t look like what women have come to think of as ‘marriage material’ (<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/america-marriage-decline/681518"">Derek Thompson, <i>“America’s ‘Marriage Material’ Shortage”</i>, February 3rd, 2025</a>)<br><br>So maybe if we look closer, <i>A Doll’s House</i> isn’t just about Nora’s oppression—it’s about Torvald’s, too. Torvald isn’t a villain in the mustache-twirling sense; he’s just as much a product of the system as Nora is. He has been taught that his value lies in his financial success and that his social status depends on having a pretty, obedient, and amusing wife.<br><br>If to be loved is to be known, Torvald does not love Nora because he does not truly know her. But to his defense, Nora has crafted her own identity to satisfy the men around her—if she doesn’t know herself, how can she expect Torvald to know her?<br><br><blockquote>NORA: It’s true, Torvald. When I lived at home with Papa, he used to tell me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinion. If I thought differently, I had to hide it from him, or he wouldn’t have liked it. He called me his little doll, and he used to play with me just as I played with my dolls. Then I came to live in your house—<br>HELMER: That’s no way to talk about our marriage!<br>NORA (undisturbed): I mean when I passed out of Papa’s hands into yours. You arranged everything to suit your own tastes, and so I came to have the same tastes as yours… or I pretended to. I’m not quite sure which—perhaps it was a bit of both.</blockquote><br><br>Perhaps Nora is right to walk away; she certainly deserves to understand herself. But will taking on the world alone—working solely for her own self-interest—really make her happy?<br><br>Mrs. Linde provides an interesting foil to Nora and challenges both the ideal of traditional marriage &amp; the appeal of independence. Mrs. Linde has already experienced a loveless marriage, one she entered for her family’s financial security. After her husband dies and her finances deteriorate, she chooses to seek employment rather than remarry. <br><br>While Mrs. Linde finds purpose in her work, she also feels ""miserable"" without someone to care for. In the final act, she reunites with Krogstad, whom she had loved before her marriage but left because he couldn’t provide the financial security her family needed. Despite Krogstad’s lack of status and job, Mrs. Linde chooses to be with him, not out of obligation or necessity, but out of mutual love, respect, and desire. Having experienced an unfulfilling traditional marriage, she now seeks a second-chance at a partnership founded on genuine connection. <br><br><blockquote>MRS. LINDE: I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world—my life is so dreadfully empty, and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working for one’s self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.<br>KROGSTAD: I don’t trust that. It is nothing but a woman’s overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.<br>MRS. LINDE: Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?<br>KROGSTAD: Could you really do it? Tell me—do you know all about my past life?<br>MRS. LINDE: Yes.<br>KROGSTAD: And do you know what they think of me here?<br>…<br>MRS. LINDE: I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real character—I can dare anything together with you.</blockquote><br><br>Interesting, despite <i>A Doll's House</i>'s its reputation as a feminist text, Ibsen himself rejected that label. When honored by the Norwegian Society for Women’s Rights, he replied: ""I thank you for your toast but must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for women's rights. I am not even quite sure what women's rights really are. To me it has been a question of human rights.""<br><br>Ibsen identified as a humanist. Perhaps he never intended Nora’s liberation to be the central takeaway. Instead, the model to emulate may be the second-chance marriage between Mrs. Linde and Krogstad, which is founded on mutual love, respect, and admiration, without economic incentive or social pressure.","",,"",No

This is especially true of men in more marginalized groups - i.e. boys from low income or single parent households, black men, etc.<br><br>The statistics he presents are both startling and essential to the book's thesis. For instance, men are four times more likely to die by suicide than women, yet gender isn’t even mentioned in many public health resources addressing suicide disparities. It’s these overlooked disparities that make Reeves’ analysis feel urgent.<br><br>I found the most compelling parts of the book to be chapter 1 (which highlighted educational disparities between boys and girls) and chapter 4 (which highlighted the sort of ""double disadvantage"" that black boys &amp; men experience in America).<br><br>I'm probably not going to spend time trying to convince people to read this book, but I will absolutely spend time trying to convince people to listen to Reeves on the Ezra Klein Podcast.

My dad would praise me when I did something that fell into ""the grey.""<br><br>From the very beginning, Daphne du Maurier sets up stark, black-and-white contrasts between her characters. Our young narrator meets Maxim de Winter, a man exactly twice her age. The narrator is emotional and intense, while Maxim is stoic. She wants to preserve every moment of the past; he wants to forget it. She’s naive and inexperienced; he’s established and deeply scarred by the death of his first wife, Rebecca.<br><br>Then there’s Rebecca, whose shadow “haunts” Manderley long after her death. Confident, beautiful, and seemingly without fault, Rebecca is everything the narrator is not. Where the narrator hides from company, Rebecca is a social butterfly. Where Rebecca is decisive, the narrator is hesitant.<br><br>A major twist reveals that <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Maxim is responsible for Rebecca’s death, and he may be convicted for it. Courtrooms, like much of the world, operate in binary terms — innocence or guilt, life or death. As readers, we find ourselves neither fully rooting for Maxim nor against him</details>. The characters in Rebecca are not purely good or evil. Morality is always a shade of grey. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Yes, he killed Rebecca, but if forced to choose between his conviction and hanging or him getting away with it, what would we do? We can understand why Maxim did what he did—even if we wouldn't have chosen the same path. Does that make him more evil than good, deserving of punishment, or can we see some humanity in his actions and hope he is spared?</details><br><br>Modern culture (especially internet culture) often falls into the trap of binary thinking — categorizing things into opposing extremes of good and evil, right and wrong. I think this is especially evident in how we interact with scandals and wrongdoing. <br><br>For example, this summer, when videos surfaced of a CEO and another executive having a public extramarital affair during a Coldplay concert, the internet rushed to judgment. The mistake was real, but the backlash quickly became extreme. People sent death threats, flooded the family’s social media, and condemned them publicly without pause. The viral reaction far outweighed the wrongdoing, leaving little room for nuance, context, or empathy.<br><br>In <i>Rebecca</i>, du Maurier illustrated how real life, and real people, don’t fit into these binary categories. There is always more beneath the surface. We are all a shade of grey.","",,"",No

I really enjoyed the author’s take on the seven emotional functions of art (pages 7-65). Unfortunately I thought the remaining 3/5th of the book was argued ideas that were not fully formed and supporting art that was referenced without through explanation as to why. I think there was definitely something in a few of the ideas but wish some of these topics were converted with more depth vs focusing on such breadth of subject.","",,"",No
